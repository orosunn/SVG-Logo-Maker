## Usage
After running with 'node index.js', the user is presented with a series of entry prompts. They will be asked to select up to three letters, a square, circle, or triangle shape, and a colour for each. An svg file will then be generated containing a logo which meets the specifications entered in the prompts. The logo can be viewed by opening the svg file in a browser.
